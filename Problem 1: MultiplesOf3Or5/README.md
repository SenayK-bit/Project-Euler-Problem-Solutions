## Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5

The problem asks for the sum of all the numbers below 1000 that are also multiples of 3 and 5. For this problem, the algorithm brute-forces it by checking every number below 1000 and summing the values of those that are multiples of either 5 or 3. This approach was chosen because the limit, namely 1000, is quite small.
