## Problem 8: Largest Product in a series

The problem provides a 1000 digit number and asks for the largest product that can be made from 13 adjecent digits. A brute force approach is taken for this problem. The algorithm looks at all series of adjecent 13 digits that can be made, and calculates their product. The largest product and the series from which its derived are then saved.
