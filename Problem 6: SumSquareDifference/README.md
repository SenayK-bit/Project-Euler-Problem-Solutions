## Problem 6: Sum Square Difference

The problems asks for the difference between the sum of the first 100 squares and the square of the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. Brute force is sufficient here and the algorithm proceeds by calculating the sum of the first 100 squares and the square of the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. The difference is then determined from those values.
